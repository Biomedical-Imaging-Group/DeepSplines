# DeepSplines
This repository provides a learnable linear spline module (PyTorch).

Features
------------------
* Efficient B-spline implementation of the linear spline
* Projector for imposing constraints on the slope of the spline
* Scaling parameter to automatically adjust the range of the spline
* Second-order total-variation regularization to promote linear splines with fewer regions or knots
